# vLSTM
Vectorized Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) using Matlab and GPU <br>

It supports both regular LSTM described [here](http://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/pdfs/Hochreiter97_lstm.pdf) and the multimodal LSTM described [here](http://www.jimmyren.com/papers/AAAI16_Ren.pdf). <br>

If you are interested, visit [here](https://github.com/jimmy-ren/lstm_speaker_naming_aaai16) for details of the experiments described in the multimodal LSTM paper.
